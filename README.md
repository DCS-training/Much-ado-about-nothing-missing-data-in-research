# Much Ado About Nothing: Missing Data in Research
Hello Everyone! This is the Readme File for the Much ado about nothing course (delivered by the CDCS in November 2023).

This workshop focused on how to explore, understand and address missing data in research, using R, R studio and some theory. We will also explore potential methods of deliberatley using missing data in our research.

The material in this repo was developed and curated by Rhys Davies.

## What will be in this repo?
* Getting Ready with R.pdf (installation instructions for R and R Studio, and the Noteable Service)
* Code Folder (the code used in the two classes)
* Data Folder (the dataset used in the two classes)
* Much_ado_about_nothing.ppt (a presentation about missing data, detailing some important theory)
* Missing data reading materials - for anyone who wants to geek out on missing data before/after the course.
